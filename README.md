# ðŸš— Advanced Image Dehazing using Dark Channel Prior

ðŸ§© Problem Statement

 Autonomous vehicles, drones, surveillance systems, robotic vision, and fire rescue operations rely heavily on computer vision for tasks such as object detection, obstacle avoidance, and lane detection. However, environmental conditions like haze, fog, and smoke degrade image quality, making it difficult to accurately identify objects and boundaries.
The goal of this project is to restore clear images from hazy or foggy environments in real-time to enhance the performance of these vision-based systems. Specifically, dehazing is critical in improving the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles operating in adverse weather conditions, ensuring proper recognition of pedestrians, vehicles, and other obstacles.
 
ðŸ“œ Overview

 This project implements real-time video dehazing using the Dark Channel Prior (DCP) algorithm. The method addresses the challenges of atmospheric scattering caused by haze, fog, or smog, which reduces image clarity and makes object detection difficult. By enhancing visibility, this solution improves the accuracy of downstream computer vision tasks like object detection and tracking.
This project has practical applications in autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, and robotic vision, where environmental factors such as fog or smoke interfere with reliable vision-based decisions.
