# ðŸš— Advanced Image Dehazing using Dark Channel Prior

ðŸ§© Problem Statement

 Autonomous vehicles, drones, surveillance systems, and robotics heavily rely on computer vision for critical tasks like object detection, obstacle avoidance, lane recognition, and navigation. However, environmental conditions such as haze, fog, smoke, and mist significantly impair the clarity of visual data, making it challenging to detect objects and navigate accurately.
This problem becomes especially critical in complex terrains like hill stations with sharp curves, hairpin bends, and steep gradients, where precise object identification and road boundary detection are essential to avoid accidents. In such areas, vehicles and drones need to accurately detect pedestrians, road signs, oncoming traffic, and unexpected obstacles under poor visibility conditions caused by adverse weather.
 
ðŸ“œ Overview

 This project implements real-time video dehazing using the Dark Channel Prior (DCP) algorithm. The method addresses the challenges of atmospheric scattering caused by haze, fog, or smog, which reduces image clarity and makes object detection difficult. By enhancing visibility, this solution improves the accuracy of downstream computer vision tasks like object detection and tracking.
This project has practical applications in autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, and robotic vision, where environmental factors such as fog or smoke interfere with reliable vision-based decisions.
