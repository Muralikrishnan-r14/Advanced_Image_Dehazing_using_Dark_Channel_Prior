# ðŸš— Advanced Image Dehazing using Dark Channel Prior
ðŸ“œ Overview

 This project implements real-time video dehazing using the Dark Channel Prior (DCP) algorithm. The method addresses the challenges of atmospheric scattering caused by haze, fog, or smog, which reduces image clarity and makes object detection difficult. By enhancing visibility, this solution improves the accuracy of downstream computer vision tasks like object detection and tracking.
This project has practical applications in autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, and robotic vision, where environmental factors such as fog or smoke interfere with reliable vision-based decisions.
